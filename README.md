## Deployment Process ðŸª‚

1. **Version Control Setup:**
   - Push source files to AWS CodeCommit, setting up a repository for version control.

2. **Build Automation:**
   - Configure AWS CodeBuild with build scripts to automate the build process whenever changes are pushed to the repository and save the build artifacts to an S3 bucket.

3. **Deployment Automation:**
   - Create deployment scripts and configure AWS CodeDeploy to automate the deployment process to an EC2 instance.

4. **Pipeline Automation:**
   - Set up AWS CodePipeline to integrate the version control, build, and deployment processes, creating a seamless CI/CD pipeline.

## Key Learnings âœ¨

- Implementing the CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline streamlines the build and deployment process, enhancing efficiency and reducing operational overhead.
